Small script I made today (~17th of June 2024). 
The main function armToStr takes Eastern Armenian sounds into account, and returns a transcription I basically came up with myself (it is French inspired).
Western Armenian could be added by modifying the dictionnary, adding another function, etc.

I didn't know if a method already existed to transform a list into a string, so I added a function for it.
Feel free to notify me any mistake in the transcription of a letter, or any possible improvements to the code.
